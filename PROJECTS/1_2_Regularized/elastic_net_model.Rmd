## Elastic Net Model

Elastic Net is a regularization technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties in a linear regression model. This technique is commonly used in machine learning, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or situations where some of the features are highly correlated.

In elastic net regularization, the objective function is a combination of the L1 and L2 regularization terms along with the linear regression loss. The regularization strength is controlled by two hyperparameters, often denoted as 
α
α (alpha) and 
λ
λ (lambda):

α
α controls the mixing between L1 and L2 regularization. When 
α
=
0
α=0, it is equivalent to Ridge regression, and when 
α
=
1
α=1, it is equivalent to Lasso regression. Any value in between (0 and 1) allows for a mixture of both.
λ
λ controls the overall strength of the regularization.


In R, you can fit an elastic net model using the glmnet package. Here's a brief example:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install and load the glmnet package if not already installed
# install.packages("glmnet")
library(glmnet)

# Generate some example data
set.seed(42)
n <- 100
p <- 10
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p), nrow = n, ncol = p)
beta_true <- c(2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, -2, 0)
y <- X %*% beta_true + rnorm(n)

# Fit an elastic net model
alpha <- 0.5  # You can adjust alpha to control the mixture of L1 and L2 regularization
lambda <- 0.1  # You can adjust lambda to control the overall strength of regularization

enet_model <- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = alpha, lambda = lambda)

```
