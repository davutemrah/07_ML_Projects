[Original article](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/survival_analysis_in_r_tutorial.html)

Survival data are time-to-event data that consist of a distinct start time and end time.

Examples from cancer:

- Time from surgery to death
- Time from start of treatment to progression
- Time from response to recurrence
- Time-to-event data are common in many other fields. 

Some other examples include:

- Time from HIV infection to development of AIDS
- Time to heart attack
- Time to onset of substance abuse
- Time to initiation of sexual activity
- Time to machine malfunction

Because time-to-event data are common in many fields, it also goes by names besides survival analysis including:

- Reliability analysis
- Duration analysis
- Event history analysis
- Time-to-event analysis

A key feature of survival data is censoring.

Censoring occurs if a subject has not experienced the event of interest by the end of data collection.

A subject may be censored due to:

- Loss to follow-up
- Withdrawal from study
- No event by end of fixed study period

Specifically these are examples of **right censoring.**

**Left censoring** and **interval censoring** are also possible, and methods exist to analyze these types of data, but this tutorial will be focus on right censoring.

To illustrate the impact of censoring, suppose we have the following data:

![](figs/survival1.png)

How would we compute the proportion who are event-free at 10 years?

- Subjects 6 and 7 were event-free at 10 years.
- Subjects 2, 9, and 10 had the event before 10 years.
- Subjects 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 were censored before 10 years, so we don’t know whether they had the event or not at 10 years. But we know something about them - that they were each followed for a certain amount of time without the event of interest prior to being censored.


Survival analysis techniques provide a way to appropriately account for censored patients in the analysis.

```{r}
# install.packages(c("lubridate", "ggsurvfit", "gtsummary", "tidycmprsk"))
library(lubridate)
library(ggsurvfit)
library(gtsummary)
library(tidycmprsk)

# devtools::install_github("zabore/condsurv")
library(condsurv)
```


**The lung dataset**

Throughout this section, we will use the `lung` dataset from the `survival` package as example data. The data contain subjects with advanced lung cancer from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. We will focus on the following variables throughout this tutorial:

     **time:** Observed survival time in days
     **status:** censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead
     **sex:** 1=Male, 2=Female

```{r}
head(lung[, c("time", "status", "sex")])
```

Note that the status is coded in a non-standard way in this dataset. Typically you will see 1=event, 0=censored. Let’s recode it to avoid confusion:

```{r}
lung1 <- 
  lung %>% 
  mutate(
    status = recode(status, '1' = 0, '2' = 1)
  )

head(lung[, c("time", "status", "sex")])
```


Now we have:

    time: Observed survival time in days
    status: censoring status 0=censored, 1=dead
    sex: 1=Male, 2=Female

Note: the `Surv()` function in the {`survival`} package accepts by default TRUE/FALSE, where TRUE is event and FALSE is censored; 1/0 where 1 is event and 0 is censored; or 2/1 where 2 is event and 1 is censored. Please take care to ensure the event indicator is properly formatted.


**Calculating survival times**

Data will often come with start and end dates rather than pre-calculated survival times. The first step is to make sure these are formatted as dates in R.

Let’s create a small example dataset with variables `sx_date` for surgery date and `last_fup_date` for the last follow-up date:


```{r}
date_ex <- 
  tibble(
    sx_date = c("2007-06-22", "2004-02-13", "2010-10-27"), 
    last_fup_date = c("2017-04-15", "2018-07-04", "2016-10-31")
    )

date_ex
```

We see these are both `character` variables, but we need them to be formatted as `dates.`

We will use the {`lubridate`} package to work with dates. In this case, we need to use the `ymd()` function to change the format, since the dates are currently in the character format where the year comes first, followed by the month, and followed by the day.

```{r}
date_ex1 <-
  date_ex %>% 
  mutate(
    sx_date = ymd(sx_date), 
    last_fup_date = ymd(last_fup_date)
    )

date_ex1
```

Now that the dates are formatted, we need to calculate the difference between start and end dates in some units, usually months or years. Using the {`lubridate`} package, the operator `%--%` designates a time interval, which is then converted to the number of elapsed seconds using `as.duration()` and finally converted to years by dividing by `dyears(1)`, which gives the number of seconds in a year.

```{r}
date_ex2 <-
  date_ex1 %>% 
  mutate(
    observed_yrs = as.duration(sx_date %--% last_fup_date) / dyears(1)
    )

date_ex2
```

#### Creating survival objects and curves

The Kaplan-Meier method is the most common way to estimate survival times and probabilities. It is a `non-parametric` approach that results in a step function, where there is a step down each time an event occurs.

Lets see the data again:

```{r}
lung[, c("time", "status")][1:5, ]
```


The `Surv()` function from the {`survival`} package creates a survival object for use as the response in a model formula. There will be one entry for each subject that is the survival time, which is followed by a + if the subject was censored. 

Let’s look at the first 10 observations:

```{r}
Surv(lung$time, lung$status)[1:10]
```

We see that subject 1 had an event at time 306 days, subject 2 had an event at time 455 days, subject 3 was censored at time 1010 days, etc.

The `survfit()` function creates survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method based on a formula. Let’s generate the overall survival curve for the entire cohort, assign it to object s1, and look at the structure using `str()`:

```{r}
s1 <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung)
str(s1)
```

**n:** There are 228 subjects in the data.

**time:** Distinct time points.

**n.risk:** Number of cases that have survived to the time plus the number of cases where the event occurs at the exact time. 

**n.event:** Number of event happened at the time.


#### Kaplan-Meier plots/Curves

The Kaplan Meier curve graphically represent the survival rate or survival function. 

We will use the {`ggsurvfit`} package to generate Kaplan-Meier plots. 

This package aims to ease plotting of time-to-event endpoints using the power of the {`ggplot2`} package. See http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/ggsurvfit/index.html for details.

Note: alternatively, survival plots can be created using base R or the {`survminer`} package.

The {`ggsurvfit`} package works best if you create the `survfit` object using the included `ggsurvfit::survfit2()` function, which uses the same syntax to what we saw previously with `survival::survfit()`.

The `ggsurvfit::survfit2()` tracks the environment from the function call, which allows the plot to have better default values for labeling and p-value reporting.

```{r}
survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung) %>% 
  ggsurvfit() +
  labs(
    x = "Days",
    y = "Overall survival probability"
  )
```


The default plot in `ggsurvfit()` shows the step function only. 

We can add the confidence interval using `add_confidence_interval()`:

```{r}
survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung) %>% 
  ggsurvfit() +
  labs(
    x = "Days",
    y = "Overall survival probability"
  ) + 
  add_confidence_interval()
```


Typically we will also want to see the numbers at risk in a table below the x-axis.

We can add this using `add_risktable()`:

```{r}
survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung) %>% 
  ggsurvfit() +
  labs(
    x = "Days",
    y = "Overall survival probability"
    ) + 
  add_confidence_interval() +
  add_risktable()
```


Plots can be customized using many standard {ggplot2} options.

#### Estimating x-year survival

One quantity often of interest in a survival analysis is the probability of surviving beyond a certain number of years, x.

For example, to estimate the probability of surviving to 1 year, use summary with the times argument 
(Note: the time variable in the lung data is actually in days, so we need to use `times = 365.25`)

```{r}
summary(survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung), times = 365.25)
```

    We find that the 1-year probability of survival in this study is 41%.

The associated lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval are also displayed.

The 1-year survival probability is the point on the y-axis that corresponds to 1
 year on the x-axis for the survival curve.

![](figs/survival3.png)

What happens if you use a “naive” estimate? Here “naive” means that the patients who were censored prior to 1-year are considered event-free and included in the denominator.

121 of the 228 patients in the lung data died by 1 year so the “naive” estimate is calculated as:

$$(1−\frac{121}{228})×100=47\%$$

You get an incorrect estimate of the 1-year probability of survival when you ignore the fact that 42 patients were censored before 1-year.

Recall the correct estimate of the 1-year probability of survival, accounting for censoring using the Kaplan-Meier method, was 41%.

Ignoring censoring leads to an overestimate of the overall survival probability.

Imagine two studies, each with 228 subjects. There are 165 deaths in each study. Censoring is ignored in one (blue line), censoring is accounted for in the other (yellow line). 

The censored subjects only contribute information for a portion of the follow-up time, and then fall out of the risk set, thus pulling down the cumulative probability of survival. Ignoring censoring erroneously treats patients who are censored as part of the risk set for the entire follow-up period.


![](figs/survival4.png)

We can produce nice tables of x-time survival probability estimates using the `tbl_survfit()` function from the {`gtsummary`} package:

```{r}
survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung) %>% 
  tbl_survfit(
    times = 365.25,
    label_header = "**1-year survival (95% CI)**"
  )
```



#### Estimating median survival time

Another quantity often of interest in a survival analysis is the average survival time, which we quantify using the median. Survival times are not expected to be normally distributed so the mean is not an appropriate summary.

We can obtain the median survival directly from the `survfit` object:

```{r}
survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung)
```


We see the median survival time is 310 days The lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval are also displayed.

Median survival is the time corresponding to a survival probability of 0.5:

![](figs/survival5.png)

What happens if you use a “naive” estimate? Here “naive” means that you exclude the censored patients from the calculation entirely to estimate median survival time among the patients who have had the event.

Summarize the median survival time among the 165 patients who died:

```{r}
lung %>% 
  filter(status == 1) %>% 
  summarize(median_surv = median(time))
```


You get an incorrect estimate of median survival time of 284 days when you ignore the fact that censored patients also contribute follow-up time.

Recall the correct estimate of median survival time is 310 days.

Ignoring censoring will lead to an underestimate of median survival time because the follow-up time that censored patients contribute is excluded (blue line). The true survival curve accounting for censoring in the lung data is shown in yellow for comparison.


![](figs/survival6.png)

We can produce nice tables of median survival time estimates using the `tbl_survfit()` function from the {`gtsummary`} package:

```{r}
survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = lung) %>% 
  tbl_survfit(
    probs = 0.5,
    label_header = "**Median survival (95% CI)**"
  )
```


#### Comparing survival times between groups

We can conduct between-group significance tests using a `log-rank test`. 

The log-rank test equally weights observations over the entire follow-up time and is the most common way to compare survival times between groups. There are versions that more heavily weight the early or late follow-up that could be more appropriate depending on the research question (see `?survdiff` for different test options).

We get the log-rank p-value using the `survdiff` function. For example, we can test whether there was a difference in survival time according to sex in the lung data:

```{r}
survdiff(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
```

We see that there was a significant difference in overall survival according to sex in the lung data, with a p-value of `p = 0.001`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require("survival")
library("survminer")

fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)

ggsurvplot(fit, data = lung)
```


```{r}
ggsurvplot(
  fit,
  data = lung,
  size = 1,                 # change line size
  palette =
    c("#E7B800", "#2E9FDF"),# custom color palettes
  conf.int = TRUE,          # Add confidence interval
  pval = TRUE,              # Add p-value
  risk.table = TRUE,        # Add risk table
  risk.table.col = "strata",# Risk table color by groups
  legend.labs =
    c("Male", "Female"),    # Change legend labels
  risk.table.height = 0.25, # Useful to change when you have multiple groups
  ggtheme = theme_bw()      # Change ggplot2 theme
)
```



#### The Cox regression model

We may want to quantify an effect size for a single variable, or include more than one variable into a regression model to account for the effects of multiple variables.

The Cox regression model is a semi-parametric model that can be used to fit univariable and multivariable regression models that have survival outcomes.

$$h(t|Xi)=h0(t)exp(β1Xi1+⋯+βpXip)$$

$h(t)$
: hazard, or the instantaneous rate at which events occur h0(t)
: underlying baseline hazard

Some key assumptions of the model:

non-informative censoring
proportional hazards

**Note:** parametric regression models for survival outcomes are also available, but they won’t be addressed here.

We can fit regression models for survival data using the `coxph()` function from the {`survival`} package, which takes a `Surv()` object on the left hand side and has standard syntax for regression formulas in R on the right hand side.

```{r}
coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
```


We can obtain tables of results using the `tbl_regression()` function from the {`gtsummary`} package, with the option to `exponentiate` set to `TRUE` to return the hazard ratio rather than the log hazard ratio:

```{r}
coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung) %>% 
  tbl_regression(exp = TRUE)
```


The quantity of interest from a Cox regression model is a hazard ratio (HR). The HR represents the ratio of hazards between two groups at any particular point in time. 

The HR is interpreted as the instantaneous rate of occurrence of the event of interest in those who are still at risk for the event. It is not a risk, though it is commonly mis-interpreted as such. If you have a regression parameter β, then $HR = exp(β)$

A HR < 1 indicates reduced hazard of death whereas a HR > 1 indicates an increased hazard of death.

So the HR = 0.59 implies that 0.59 times as many females are dying as males, at any given time. Stated differently, females have a significantly lower hazard of death than males in these data.
