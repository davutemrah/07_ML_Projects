<p>At its core, data science is using data to answer questions. This is a pretty broad definition, and that’s because it’s a pretty broad field!</p>
<p>Data science can involve:</p>
<p>• Statistics, computer science, mathematics</p>
<p>• Data cleaning and formatting</p>
<p>• Data visualization</p>
<p>An Economist Special Report sums up this mélange of skills well - they state that a data scientist is broadly defined as someone:
“who combines the skills of software programmer, statistician and storyteller slash artist to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data”</p>
</div>
<div id="why-do-we-need-data-science" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.2</span> Why do we need data science?<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#why-do-we-need-data-science" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>One of the reasons for the rise of data science in recent years is the vast amount of data currently available and being generated. Not only are massive amounts of data being collected about many aspects of the world and our lives, but we simultaneously have the rise of inexpensive computing. This has created the perfect storm in which we have rich data and the tools to analyse it: Rising computer memory capabilities, better processors, more software and now, more data scientists with the skills to put this to use and answer questions using this data!</p>
<p>There is a little anecdote that describes the truly exponential growth of data generation we are experiencing. In the third century BC, the Library of Alexandria was believed to house the sum of human knowledge. Today, there is enough information in the world to give every person alive 320 times as much of it as historians think was stored in Alexandria’s entire collection.</p>
<p>And that is still growing.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-big-data" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.3</span> What is big data?<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#what-is-big-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>It has been so integral to the rise of data science. There are a few qualities that characterize big data. The first is <code>volume.</code> As the name implies, big data involves large datasets - and these large datasets are becoming more and more routine. For example, say you had a question about online video - well, YouTube has approximately 300 hours of video uploaded every minute! You would definitely have a lot of data available to you to analyse, but you can see how this might be a difficult problem to wrangle all of that data!</p>
<p>And this brings us to the second quality of big data: <code>velocity.</code> Data is being generated and collected faster than ever before. In our YouTube example, new data is coming at you every minute! In a completely different example, say you have a question about shipping times or routes. Well, most transport trucks have real time GPS data available - you could in real time analyse the trucks movements… if you have the tools and skills to do so!</p>
<p>The third quality of big data is <code>variety.</code> In the examples I’ve mentioned so far, you have different types of data available to you. In the YouTube example, you could be analysing video or audio, which is a very unstructured data set, or you could have a database of video lengths, views or comments, which is a much more structured dataset to analyse.</p>
</div>
<div id="descriptive-analysis" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.4</span> 1. Descriptive analysis<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#descriptive-analysis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The goal of descriptive analysis is to describe or summarize a set of data. Whenever you get a new dataset to examine, this is usually the first kind of analysis you will perform. Descriptive analysis will generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements. You may be familiar with common descriptive statistics: measures of central tendency (eg: mean, median, mode) or measures of variability (eg: range, standard deviations or variance).
This type of analysis is aimed at summarizing your sample – not for generalizing the results of the analysis to a larger population or trying to make conclusions. Description of data is separated from making interpretations; generalizations and interpretations require additional statistical steps.
Some examples of purely descriptive analysis can be seen in censuses. Here, the government collects a series of measurements on all of the country’s citizens, which can then be summarized. Here, you are being shown the age distribution in the US, stratified by sex.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.5">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.5</span> 2. Exploratory analysis<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#exploratory-analysis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The goal of exploratory analysis is to examine or explore the data and find relationships that weren’t previously known. Exploratory analyses explore how different measures might be related to each other but do not confirm that relationship as causitive. You’ve probably heard the phrase “Correlation does not imply causation” and exploratory analyses lie at the root of this saying. Just because you observe a relationship between two variables during exploratory analysis, it does not mean that one necessarily causes the other.
Because of this, exploratory analyses, while useful for discovering new connections, should not be the final say in answering a question! It can allow you to formulate hypotheses and drive the design of future studies and data collection, but exploratory analysis alone should never be used as the final say on why or how data might be related to each other.</p>
</div>
<div id="inferential-analysis" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.6">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.6</span> 3. Inferential analysis<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#inferential-analysis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The goal of inferential analyses is to use a relatively small sample of data to infer or say something about the population at large. Inferential analysis is commonly the goal of statistical modelling, where you have a small amount of information to extrapolate and generalize that information to a larger group.</p>
<p>Inferential analysis typically involves using the data you have to estimate that value in the population and then give a measure of your uncertainty about your estimate. Since you are moving from a small amount of data and trying to generalize to a larger population, your ability to accurately infer information about the larger population depends heavily on your sampling scheme - if the data you collect is not from a representative sample of the population, the generalizations you infer won’t be accurate for the population.</p>
</div>
<div id="predictive-analysis" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.7">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.7</span> 4. Predictive analysis<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#predictive-analysis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The goal of predictive analysis is to use current data to make predictions about future data. Essentially, you are using current and historical data to find patterns and predict the likelihood of future outcomes.
Like in inferential analysis, your accuracy in predictions is dependent on measuring the right variables. If you aren’t measuring the right variables to predict an outcome, your predictions aren’t going to be accurate. Additionally, there are many ways to build up prediction models with some being better or worse for specific cases, but in general, having more data and a simple model generally performs well at predicting future outcomes.
All this being said, much like in exploratory analysis, just because one variable may predict another, it does not mean that one causes the other; you are just capitalizing on this observed relationship to predict the second variable.
A common saying is that prediction is hard, especially about the future. There aren’t easy ways to gauge how well you are going to predict an event until that event has come to pass; so evaluating different approaches or models is a challenge.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time trying to predict things - the upcoming weather, the outcomes of sports events, and in the example we’ll explore here, the outcomes of elections. We’ve previously mentioned Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, where they try and predict the outcomes of U.S. elections (and sports matches, too!). Using historical polling data and trends and current polling, FiveThirtyEight builds models to predict the outcomes in the next US Presidential vote - and has been fairly accurate at doing so! FiveThirtyEight’s models accurately predicted the 2008 and 2012 elections and was widely considered an outlier in the 2016 US elections, as it was one of the few models to suggest Donald Trump at having a chance of winning.</p>
</div>
<div id="causal-analysis" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.8">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.8</span> Causal analysis<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#causal-analysis" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The caveat to a lot of the analyses we’ve looked at so far is that we can only see correlations and can’t get at the cause of the relationships we observe. Causal analysis fills that gap; the goal of causal analysis is to see what happens to one variable when we manipulate another variable - looking at the cause and effect of a relationship.
Generally, causal analyses are fairly complicated to do with observed data alone; there will always be questions as to whether it is correlation driving your conclusions or that the assumptions underlying your analysis are valid. More often, causal analyses are applied to the results of randomized studies that were designed to identify causation. Causal analysis is often considered the gold standard in data analysis, and is seen frequently in scientific studies where scientists are trying to identify the cause of a phenomenon, but often getting appropriate data for doing a causal analysis is a challenge.
One thing to note about causal analysis is that the data is usually analysed in aggregate and observed relationships are usually average effects; so, while on average giving a certain population a drug may alleviate the symptoms of a disease, this causal relationship may not hold true for every single affected individual.</p>
</div>
<div id="experimental-design" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.9">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.9</span> Experimental Design<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#experimental-design" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Now that we’ve looked at the different types of data science questions, we are going to spend some time looking at experimental design concepts. As a data scientist, you are a scientist and as such, need to have the ability to design proper experiments to best answer your data science questions!
What does experimental design mean?
Experimental design is organizing an experiment so that you have the correct data (and enough of it!) to clearly and effectively answer your data science question. This process involves clearly formulating your question in advance of any data collection, designing the best set-up possible to gather the data to answer your question, identifying problems or sources of error in your design, and only then, collecting the appropriate data.
Why should you care?</p>
</div>
<div id="confounder" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1.10">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.10</span> Confounder:<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#confounder" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>An extraneous variable that may affect the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
In our example, since age affects foot size and literacy is affected by age, if we see any relationship between shoe size and literacy, the relationship may actually be due to age – age is “confounding” our experimental design!
To control for this, we can make sure we also measure the age of each individual so that we can take into account the effects of age on literacy, as well. Another way we could control for age’s effect on literacy would be to fix the age of all participants. If everyone we study is the same age, then we have removed the possible effect of age on literacy.</p>
<p>Age is confounding my experimental design! We need to control for this
In other experimental design paradigms, a control group may be appropriate. This is when you have a group of experimental subjects that are not manipulated. So if you were studying the effect of a drug on survival, you would have a group that received the drug (treatment) and a group that did not (control). This way, you can compare the effects of the drug in the treatment versus control group.</p>
<p>A control group is a group of subjects that do not receive the treatment, but still have their dependent variables measured
In these study designs, there are other strategies we can use to control for confounding effects. One, we can blind the subjects to their assigned treatment group. Sometimes, when a subject knows that they are in the treatment group (eg: receiving the experimental drug), they can feel better, not from the drug itself, but from knowing they are receiving treatment. This is known as the placebo effect. To combat this, often participants are blinded to the treatment group they are in; this is usually achieved by giving the control group a mock treatment (eg: given a sugar pill they are told is the drug). In this way, if the placebo effect is causing a problem with your experiment, both groups should experience it equally.</p>
<p>Blinding your study means that your subjects don’t know what group they belong to - all participants receive a “treatment”
And this strategy is at the heart of many of these studies; spreading any possible confounding effects equally across the groups being compared. For example, if you think age is a possible confounding effect, making sure that both groups have similar ages and age ranges will help to mitigate any effect age may be having on your dependent variable - the effect of age is equal between your two groups.
This “balancing” of confounders is often achieved by randomization. Generally, we don’t know what will be a confounder beforehand; to help lessen the risk of accidentally biasing one group to be enriched for a confounder, you can randomly assign individuals to each of your groups. This means that any potential confounding variables should be distributed between each group roughly equally, to help eliminate/reduce systematic errors.</p>
<p>Randomizing subjects to either the control or treatment group is a great strategy to reduce confounders’ effects
There is one final concept of experimental design that we need to cover in this lesson, and that is replication. Replication is pretty much what it sounds like, repeating an experiment with different experimental subjects. A single experiment’s results may have occured by chance; a confounder was unevenly distributed across your groups, there was a systematic error in the data collection, there were some outliers, etc. However, if you can repeat the experiment and collect a whole new set of data and still come to the same conclusion, your study is much stronger. Also at the heart of replication is that it allows you to measure the variability of your data more accurately, which allows you to better assess whether any differences you see in your data are significant.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.11</span> Beware p-hacking!<a href="machine-learning-fundamentals.html#beware-p-hacking" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>One of the many things often reported in experiments is a value called the p-value. This is a value that tells you the probability that the results of your experiment were observed by chance. This is a very important concept in statistics that we won’t be covering in depth here, if you want to know more, check out this video explaining more about p-values.
What you need to look out for is when you manipulate p-values towards your own end. Often, when your p-value is less than 0.05 (in other words, there is a 5 percent chance that the differences you saw were observed by chance), a result is considered significant. But if you do 20 tests, by chance, you would expect one of the twenty (5%) to be significant. In the age of big data, testing twenty hypotheses is a very easy proposition. And this is where the term p-hacking comes from: This is when you exhaustively search a data set to find patterns and correlations that appear statistically significant by virtue of the sheer number of tests you have performed. These spurious correlations can be reported as significant and if you perform enough tests, you can find a data set and analysis that will show you what you wanted to see.
Check out this FiveThirtyEight activity where you can manipulate and filter data and perform a series of tests such that you can get the data to find whatever relationship you want!
XKCD mocks this concept in a comic testing the link between jelly beans and acne - clearly there is no link there, but if you test enough jelly bean colours, eventually, one of them will be correlated with acne at p-value &lt; 0.05!</p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Overfitting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Statistical model is too complex</p></li>
<li><p>Too many parameters when compared to the total number of observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Poor Predictive Performance</p></li>
<li><p>Overfitted model overreacts to minor fluctuations in the training data</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Underfitting:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Statistical model is too primitive</p></li>
<li><p>Poor Predictive Performance in the training model</p></li>
<li><p>The underfit model under-reacts to even bigger fluctuations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bias:</strong></p>
<p>Bias is an error introduced in your model because of the oversimplification of a machine learning algorithm. It can lead to underfitting.</p>
<p>In supervised learning, underfitting happens when a model unable to capture the underlying pattern of the data. These models usually have high bias and low variance. It happens when we have very less amount of data to build an accurate model or when we try to build a linear model with a nonlinear data.</p>
<p>Also, these kinds of models are very simple to capture the complex patterns in data like Linear and logistic regression.</p>
<p>In supervised learning, overfitting happens when our model captures the noise along with the underlying pattern in data.</p>
<p>It happens when we train our model a lot over noisy dataset. These models have low bias and high variance. These models are very complex like Decision trees which are prone to overfitting.</p>
<p>Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It always leads to high error on training and test data.</p>
<p><strong>What is variance?</strong></p>
<p>Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasn’t seen before. As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data. (over-fitting issue)</p>
<p><strong>Why is Bias - Variance Trade-off?</strong></p>
<p>If our model is too simple and has very few parameters then it may have high bias and low variance. On the other hand, if our model has large number of parameters then it’s going to have high variance and low bias. So, we need to find the right/good balance without overfitting and underfitting the data.</p>
<p><strong>Name three types of biases that can occur during sampling</strong></p>
<p>In the sampling process, there are three types of biases, which are:</p>
<p>• Selection bias
• Under coverage bias
• Survivorship bias</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What do you understand by the Selection Bias? What are its various types?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Selection bias is typically associated with research that doesn’t have a random selection of participants. It is a type of error that occurs when a researcher decides who is going to be studied. On some occasions, selection bias is also referred to as the selection effect.</p>
<p>In other words, selection bias is a distortion of statistical analysis that results from the sample collecting method. When selection bias is not taken into account, some conclusions made by a research study might not be accurate. Following are the various types of selection bias:</p>
<p>• Sampling Bias – A systematic error resulting due to a non-random sample of a populace causing certain members of the same to be less likely included than others that results in a biased sample.</p>
<p>• Time Interval – A trial might be ended at an extreme value, usually due to ethical reasons, but the extreme value is most likely to be reached by the variable with the most variance, even though all variables have a similar mean.</p>
<p>• Data – Results when specific data subsets are selected for supporting a conclusion or rejection of bad data arbitrarily.</p>
<p>• Attrition – Caused due to attrition, i.e. loss of participants, discounting trial subjects or tests that didn’t run to completion.</p>

<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Name three disadvantages of using a linear model
Three disadvantages of the linear model are:
• The assumption of linearity of the errors.
• You can’t use this model for binary or count outcomes
• There are plenty of overfitting problems that it can’t solve</p></li>
<li><p>Why do you need to perform resampling?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Resampling is done in below-given cases:

Boosting
Boosting is an iterative method which allows you to adjust the weight of an observation depends upon the last classification. Boosting decreases the bias error and helps you to build strong predictive models.
18. Explain Eigenvalue and Eigenvector
Eigenvectors are for understanding linear transformations. Data scientist need to calculate the eigenvectors for a covariance matrix or correlation. Eigenvalues are the directions along using specific linear transformation acts by compressing, flipping, or stretching.
Question: Please explain Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues.
Answer: Eigenvectors help in understanding linear transformations. They are calculated typically for a correlation or covariance matrix in data analysis.
In other words, eigenvectors are those directions along which some particular linear transformation acts by compressing, flipping, or stretching.

</ol>
<p>Question: What do you mean by cluster sampling and systematic sampling?
Answer: When studying the target population spread throughout a wide area becomes difficult and applying simple random sampling becomes ineffective, the technique of cluster sampling is used. A cluster sample is a probability sample, in which each of the sampling units is a collection or cluster of elements.
Following the technique of systematic sampling, elements are chosen from an ordered sampling frame. The list is advanced in a circular fashion. This is done in such a way so that once the end of the list is reached, the same is progressed from the start, or top, again.</p>

</ol>
<p>Question: Could you explain how to define the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm?
Answer: The primary objective of clustering is to group together similar identities in such a way that while entities within a group are similar to each other, the groups remain different from one another.
Generally, the Within Sum of Squares is used for explaining the homogeneity within a cluster. For defining the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm, WSS is plotted for a range pertaining to a number of clusters. The resultant graph is known as the Elbow Curve.
The Elbow Curve graph contains a point that represents the point post in which there aren’t any decrements in the WSS. This is known as the bending point and represents K in K–Means.
Although the aforementioned is the widely-used approach, another important approach is the Hierarchical clustering. In this approach, dendrograms are created first and then distinct groups are identified from there.</p>
<p>Question: Please explain Gradient Descent.
Answer: The degree of change in the output of a function relating to the changes made to the inputs is known as a gradient. It measures the change in all weights with respect to the change in error. A gradient can also be comprehended as the slope of a function.
Gradient Descent refers to escalating down to the bottom of a valley. Simply, consider this something as opposed to climbing up a hill. It is a minimization algorithm meant for minimizing a given activation function.</p>
<p>Question: Please enumerate the various steps involved in an analytics project.
Answer: Following are the numerous steps involved in an analytics project:
• Understanding the business problem
• Exploring the data and familiarizing with the same
• Preparing the data for modeling by means of detecting outlier values, transforming variables, treating missing values, et cetera
• Running the model and analyzing the result for making appropriate changes or modifications to the model (an iterative step that repeats until the best possible outcome is gained)
• Validating the model using a new dataset
• Implementing the model and tracking the result for analyzing the performance of the same</p>
<p>Question: What are outlier values and how do you treat them?
Answer: Outlier values, or simply outliers, are data points in statistics that don’t belong to a certain population. An outlier value is an abnormal observation that is very much different from other values belonging to the set.
Identification of outlier values can be done by using univariate or some other graphical analysis method. Few outlier values can be assessed individually but assessing a large set of outlier values require the substitution of the same with either the 99th or the 1st percentile values.
There are two popular ways of treating outlier values:
1. To change the value so that it can be brought within a range
2. To simply remove the value
Note: - Not all extreme values are outlier values.</p>
<ol start="21" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Discuss Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial Neural networks (ANN) are a special set of algorithms that have revolutionized machine learning. It helps you to adapt according to changing input. So the network generates the best possible result without redesigning the output criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>What is Back Propagation?
Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. It is the method of tuning the weights of a neural net depend upon the error rate obtained in the previous epoch. Proper tuning of the helps you to reduce error rates and to make the model reliable by increasing its generalization.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Explain Auto-Encoder</strong></p>
<p>Autoencoders are learning networks. It helps you to transform inputs into outputs with fewer numbers of errors. This means that you will get output to be as close to input as possible.</p>
<ol start="36" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Define Boltzmann Machine
Boltzmann machines is a simple learning algorithm. It helps you to discover those features that represent complex regularities in the training data. This algorithm allows you to optimize the weights and the quantity for the given problem.</p></li>
<li><p>What is reinforcement learning?
Reinforcement Learning is a learning mechanism about how to map situations to actions. The end result should help you to increase the binary reward signal. In this method, a learner is not told which action to take but instead must discover which action offers a maximum reward. As this method based on the reward/penalty mechanism.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Training-Validation-Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We typically train our model but get evaluation metrics on the test data.</li>
</ul>
<p>From ISLR:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In general, we do not really care how well the method works on the training data. Rather, we are interested in the accuracy of the predictions that we obtain when we apply our method to previously unseen data. Why is this what we care about? Suppose that we are interested in developing an algorithm to predict a stock’s price based on previous stock returns. We can train the method using stock returns from the past 6 months. But we don’t really care how well our method predicts last week’s stock price. We instead care about how well it will predict tomorrow’s price or next month’s price.</p></li>
<li><p>We can use patients data to train a statistical learning method to predict risk of diabetes based on clinical measurements. In practice, we want this method to accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients based on their clinical measurements. We are not very interested in whether or not the method accurately predicts diabetes risk for patients used to train the model, since we already know which of those patients have diabetes.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to choose the method that gives the lowest test MSE, as opposed to the lowest training MSE.</p></li>
<li><p>The problem is that many statistical methods specifically estimate coefficients so as to minimize the training set MSE. For these methods, the training set MSE can be quite small, but the test MSE is often much larger.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>R-squared</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In simple linear regression <span class="math inline">\(r^2 = R^2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>From ISLR:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A number near 0 indicates that the regression does not explain much of the variability in the response; this might occur because the linear model is wrong, or the error variance σ2 is high, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>It can still be challenging to determine what is a good R2 value, and in general, this will depend on the application.</p></li>
<li><p>In certain problems in physics, we may know that the data truly comes from a linear model with a small residual error. In this case, we would expect to see an R2 value that is extremely close to 1, and a substantially smaller R2 value might indicate a serious problem with the experiment in which the data were generated.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, in typical applications in biology, psychology, marketing, and other domains, the linear model is at best an extremely rough approximation to the data, and residual errors due to other unmeasured factors are often very large. In this setting, we would expect only a very small proportion of the variance in the response to be explained by the predictor, and an <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value well below 0.1 might be more realistic!</p></li>
