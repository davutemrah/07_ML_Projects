## objective function in logistic regression


## Do you prefer R or python?

I prefer Python because it has a wide range of libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization, which makes it very versatile for different tasks. It's also easy to integrate with other tools and platforms. 

However, I do use R when needed, especially for specific statistical analysis and visualization tasks, as it has strong packages for these areas. I believe both languages have their strengths, and I choose based on the specific project requirements.



## What is your main domain?

My main domain is data science with a strong focus on marketing analytics. I have experience across various areas, including predictive modeling, customer segmentation, and campaign evaluation. I enjoy working on projects that involve data-driven decision-making, whether optimizing marketing strategies, understanding consumer behavior, or any other area where data can provide valuable insights.


## Is this work culture fast-paced? Do you deliver value quickly or what?

Yes, I do thrive in fast-paced environments and am comfortable delivering value quickly. 

I believe in balancing speed with quality to ensure that the work is both timely and impactful. 

In my current role, I often work under tight deadlines, and Iâ€™ve developed efficient methods to analyze data and provide actionable insights promptly.


## Are you involved in any efforts convincing business stakeholders to adept models or analysis that you do

Yes, I am often involved in convincing business stakeholders to adopt models or analyses that I develop. 

For example, in a recent project, I created a predictive model for customized user bids, which initially met some skepticism. 

I presented clear A/B test results that showed a 15% increase in conversion rates and a 10% reduction in costs. By explaining the value in simple terms and showing how it directly impacts their goals, I was able to get support for the model.




## Have you been in a situation where you feel like the model is the right way to go but either client or manager that you need to convince?

Yes, I've faced situations where I strongly believed a model was the right approach, but I needed to convince either a client or a manager. 

For instance, I once advocated for a customized bidding model based on predictive analytics. Despite initial skepticism, I presented data-driven insights and A/B test results that demonstrated significant improvements in conversion rates and cost efficiency.

By clearly explaining the model's benefits and providing evidence of its effectiveness, I successfully gained their support and implemented the model.
