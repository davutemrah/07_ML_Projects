## Neural Networks: Key Concepts for Data Science Interviews

### Basic Structure:

   - **Neurons:** The building blocks of a neural network, inspired by biological neurons. Each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and passes the output to the next layer.

   - **Layers:**

     - **Input Layer:** The first layer that receives the input data.

     - **Hidden Layers:** Intermediate layers where the actual computation happens. The depth (number of layers) and width (number of neurons in each layer) affect the network's capacity.

     - **Output Layer:** The final layer that gives the prediction or output.


### Activation Functions:

   - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** The most common activation function in hidden layers, defined as `f(x) = max(0, x)`.

   - **Sigmoid:** Often used in binary classification problems, squashes output to a range between 0 and 1.

   - **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):** Similar to sigmoid but outputs values between -1 and 1.

   - **Softmax:** Used in the output layer for multi-class classification, providing probabilities for each class.

### Forward and Backpropagation:

   - **Forward Propagation:** The process of passing input data through the network layers to get an output.

   - **Backpropagation:** The method for training neural networks, where the error (difference between predicted and actual output) is propagated back through the network to update the weights using gradient descent.

### Loss Functions:

   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Used for regression tasks, calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

   - **Cross-Entropy Loss:** Common in classification problems, measures the difference between two probability distributions.

### Optimization Algorithms:

   - **Gradient Descent:** An algorithm to minimize the loss function by updating the network's weights iteratively.

   - **Variants:**
     - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Updates weights using a single training example at a time.
     - **Mini-batch Gradient Descent:** Updates weights using a small batch of training examples.
     - **Adam:** Combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp, widely used for faster convergence.

### Regularization Techniques:

   - **L1 and L2 Regularization:** Adds a penalty to the loss function to prevent overfitting by constraining the weights.

   - **Dropout:** Randomly drops neurons during training to prevent the network from becoming too reliant on certain pathways, reducing overfitting.

### Common Architectures:

   - **Fully Connected Networks (FCNs):** Basic neural network where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and next layers.

   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Specialized for image data, using convolutional layers to detect spatial features.

   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Designed for sequence data, with connections that allow information to persist across time steps. Variants include LSTM and GRU.

   - **Transformers:** Architecture designed for sequence data, often used in NLP tasks, leveraging self-attention mechanisms.

### Overfitting and Underfitting:
   - **Overfitting:** When the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data, often due to high model complexity.
   - **Underfitting:** When the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data.
