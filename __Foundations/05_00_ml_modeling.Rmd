# ML Modeling


## Objective

**Business Problem**: Describe the business need for the look-alike modeling project. For example, "The goal was to identify potential new customers who resemble our best-performing customers to optimize marketing campaigns and drive higher ROI."




## Data Processing

### Data collection

 - We started with two datasets: one for the high-value customers (labeled dataset) and another for the potential customers (scoring dataset).

 - The labeled dataset included demographic data, browsing behavior, engagement data, and other personal financial and interest attributes.

 - The scoring dataset contained the same types of features but did not include the target variable.

### Data Cleaning

#### Missing values

#### Outliers

### Feature Engineering

#### Correlated features


I used techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical variables and normalization for continuous variables to prepare the data for modeling.


- **Data**: 
  
  - Explain how you cleaned and preprocessed the data. Mention any techniques used to handle missing values, outliers, or feature engineering.

  - For example, ""
  
- **Feature Selection**:

  - Discuss how you identified the key features that were most predictive of customer behavior. You might mention techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance from tree-based models, or principal component analysis (PCA).
  
- **Model Selection and Training**:

  - Describe the models you considered and why you chose the specific model for look-alike modeling. For instance, "I chose to use a Random Forest classifier because it handles high-dimensional data well and provides feature importance, which is valuable for understanding customer profiles."
  - Mention how you trained the model, including any cross-validation techniques you used to ensure robustness.
  
- **Model Evaluation**:

  - Explain how you evaluated the model's performance, using metrics like AUC-ROC, precision, recall, or F1 score.

  - For example, "I evaluated the model using AUC-ROC to measure its ability to distinguish between look-alike customers and non-look-alikes. The model achieved an AUC of 0.85, indicating strong predictive power."
  
### Implementation and Impact

- **Deployment**:
  - Briefly describe how the model was deployed, whether it was integrated into a marketing platform, used to score new leads, or applied in a specific campaign.
  
- **Business Impact**:
  - Highlight the results. For instance, "The look-alike model identified a segment of potential customers that, when targeted, led to a 20% increase in conversion rates compared to previous campaigns."
  - If possible, provide metrics on ROI improvement or customer acquisition cost reduction.

### Lessons Learned and Future Work

- **Challenges**:

  - Discuss any challenges you faced, such as data limitations, model tuning difficulties, or integration issues.
  
- **Future Enhancements**:

  - Mention any improvements or next steps, like using more advanced models (e.g., gradient boosting machines), incorporating additional data sources, or refining the model based on new data.
