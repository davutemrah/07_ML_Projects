# Machine Learning Fundementals


## Overfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and fluctuations rather than the underlying pattern. This leads to several issues:

- **Poor Generalization:** The model performs exceptionally well on training data but poorly on unseen test data, indicating it fails to generalize to new data.

- **Excessive Complexity:** The model is overly complex, often due to an excessive number of parameters relative to the number of observations.

- **Poor Predictive Performance:** An overfitted model has low predictive power on new data, resulting in unreliable predictions.

- **Sensitivity to Noise:** The model becomes overly sensitive to minor variations in the training data, which can result in unstable and inaccurate predictions on new data.


**To avoid overfitting, it is important to simplify the model, use regularization techniques, or apply cross-validation to ensure better generalization.**




## Underfitting

Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to several problems:

- **Overly Simple Model:** The model lacks the complexity needed to learn from the data effectively.

- **Poor Predictive Performance:** The model performs poorly not only on test data but also on training data, indicating it has not captured the data's structure well.

- **Insensitive to Patterns:** The model fails to respond even to significant trends or patterns in the data, resulting in inaccurate and unreliable predictions.


**To prevent underfitting, consider using a more complex model, adding relevant features, or reducing regularization.**



## Bias-Variance Trade-off 


### Bias

Bias is an error and can be defined as the difference between the average prediction of the model and the actual value we aim to predict. High bias occurs due to the oversimplification of the machine learning algorithm, leading to inaccurate predictions.

High-bias models result in **underfitting** and generally perform poorly on both the training and test data due to their inability to learn the underlying patterns in the data properly. 

**Causes of High Bias:** 

- High bias is often caused by using overly simplistic models for complex data, 

- or when there is insufficient data to build a robust model.


**Effect on Model Performance:** 

Models with high bias do not learn well from training data and therefore have high errors on both the training and test data.


### Variance

Variance is the variability of model predictions for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. 

Models with high variance typically are too complex models and capture all the variation in the outcome including the noise. These models are generally performs very well in the training data but performs poorly on the test data with high error rates. (over-fitting issue)


### Bias vs. Variance Trade-Off:

Your notes provide a good starting point for explaining the **bias-variance trade-off** during an interview, but they could be expanded with more detail to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concept. Here’s a more comprehensive version that you could use in an interview setting:

### Bias vs. Variance Trade-Off:

**High Bias Models:** 

Models with high bias make strong assumptions about the data, leading to oversimplification. These models, like linear regression with few features, often underfit the data, meaning they fail to capture important patterns and relationships. 

This results in both high training error and high test error. Such models are characterized by **high bias and low variance**—they perform consistently but poorly on different datasets because they are not flexible enough to model the true underlying structure of the data.


**High Variance Models:** 

On the other end, models with low bias but high variance (such as decision trees without pruning) are highly flexible and can learn intricate details of the training data. However, they tend to **overfit**, meaning they capture noise and random fluctuations in the training data rather than the general pattern. These models have **low bias but high variance**, leading to good performance on training data but poor generalization to unseen data.

**Finding the Balance:** 

The key challenge in machine learning is finding the right balance between bias and variance to minimize the **overall error** (which is the sum of bias error, variance error, and irreducible error). 

This is often done through techniques like cross-validation, regularization (e.g., Ridge or Lasso for linear models), or by using ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, which combine multiple models to reduce variance without significantly increasing bias.


**Mitigation Techniques:** 

Discuss techniques like cross-validation, regularization (L1/L2), pruning for decision trees, or using ensemble methods like bagging and boosting, which are commonly used to manage the trade-off.

**Visual Representation:** 

If possible, describe or draw the bias-variance trade-off curve, showing how training and test errors change with model complexity.

Question: Could you explain how to define the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm?
Answer: The primary objective of clustering is to group together similar identities in such a way that while entities within a group are similar to each other, the groups remain different from one another.
Generally, the Within Sum of Squares is used for explaining the homogeneity within a cluster. For defining the number of clusters in a clustering algorithm, WSS is plotted for a range pertaining to a number of clusters. The resultant graph is known as the Elbow Curve.
The Elbow Curve graph contains a point that represents the point post in which there aren’t any decrements in the WSS. This is known as the bending point and represents K in K–Means.

•	Validating the model using a new dataset
•	Implementing the model and tracking the result for analyzing the performance of the same

Question: What are outlier values and how do you treat them?
Answer: Outlier values, or simply outliers, are data points in statistics that don’t belong to a certain population. An outlier value is an abnormal observation that is very much different from other values belonging to the set.
Identification of outlier values can be done by using univariate or some other graphical analysis method. Few outlier values can be assessed individually but assessing a large set of outlier values require the substitution of the same with either the 99th or the 1st percentile values.
There are two popular ways of treating outlier values:
1.	To change the value so that it can be brought within a range
2.	To simply remove the value
Note: - Not all extreme values are outlier values.

**Training-Validation-Test**

- We typically train our model but get evaluation metrics on the test data. 

From ISLR:

- In general, we do not really care how well the method works on the training data. Rather, we are interested in the accuracy of the predictions that we obtain when we apply our method to previously unseen data. Why is this what we care about? Suppose that we are interested in developing an algorithm to predict a stock’s price based on previous stock returns. We can train the method using stock returns from the past 6 months. But we don’t really care how well our method predicts last week’s stock price. We instead care about how well it will predict tomorrow’s price or next month’s price. 

- We can use patients data to train a statistical learning method to predict risk of diabetes based on clinical measurements. In practice, we want this method to accurately predict diabetes risk for future patients based on their clinical measurements. We are not very interested in whether or not the method accurately predicts diabetes risk for patients used to train the model, since we already know which of those patients have diabetes.

- We want to choose the method that gives the lowest test MSE, as opposed to the lowest training MSE.

- The problem is that many statistical methods specifically estimate coefficients so as to minimize the training set MSE. For these methods, the training set MSE can be quite small, but the test MSE is often much larger.



**R-squared**

- In simple linear regression $r^2 = R^2$

From ISLR:

- A number near 0 indicates that the regression does not explain much of the variability in the response; this might occur because the linear model is wrong, or the error variance σ2 is high, or both.

- It can still be challenging to determine what is a good R2 value, and in general, this will depend on the application. 
 
- In certain problems in physics, we may know that the data truly comes from a linear model with a small residual error. In this case, we would expect to see an R2 value that is extremely close to 1, and a substantially smaller R2 value might indicate a serious problem with the experiment in which the data were generated.

- On the other hand, in typical applications in biology, psychology, marketing, and other domains, the linear model is at best an extremely rough approximation to the data, and residual errors due to other unmeasured factors are often very large. In this setting, we would expect only a very small proportion of the variance in the response to be explained by the predictor, and an $R^2$ value well below 0.1 might be more realistic!



**F-Test**

Testing whether all of the regression coefficients are zero, i.e. 
$H_0 :β_1 = β_2 =···=β_p = 0$

$Ha :$ at least one $β_j$ is non-zero.
